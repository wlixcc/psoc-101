PSoC 101 Training Lessons

********************************************************************************

This workspace contains all the projects for the PSoC 101 training series.

These projects target the CY8CKIT-042BLE Pioneer kit with the CY8C4247LQI-483BLE
device (PSoC 4200 BLE). Separate downloadable workspaces are available for other
Pioneer kits.

Note: When you create a new project targeting this device the main.c template
contains useful stub code for the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) component. In this
series of lessons, however, that component is not used and we recommend that you
simply delete the unnecessary code from your main.c file.

The projects are numbered and titled to match the associated training lesson
(e.g. 02-SoftwareInputPins). In addition, each lesson ends with a sugestion on
a variation you can make to the design. Suggested solutions to thoses tests are
also provided (e.g. 02-SoftwareInputPins-Test).

All projects were created using PSoC Creator 3.2. They will build without
errors or warnings on that software. They are also guaranteed to build on PSoC
Creator 3.3 although the software will prompt you to update the component
versions first.

Good luck with the lessons! If you have any problems, suggestions, or even
complaints please contact me, and my team, at alan_hawse@cypress.com.
